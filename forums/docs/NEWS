	  smiley. # * Implemented a separate mods/smileys/defaults.php file,
	  for easy # default config value maintenance and initial
	  configuration setup. # * In the $PHORUM["mod_smileys"] array,
	  smileys are not stored at the same # level as the other settings
	  anymore. # * The smiley prefix path is better checked for
	  problems. # * The smiley prefix path is forced to always have an
	  ending "/" character. # * Only files with a real image extension
	  are used in the smiley drop down. # * If configured smileys have
	  an unavailable image, the "Smiley image" # column in the overview
	  will say "UNAVAILABLE" and a clear warning message # is shown to
	  the administrator, telling him to fix the problem(s). # * The
	  smiley body & subject replacement arrays are cached in the
	  database. # * The message "no smileys configured" was never shown.
	  # * Inputs for smiley and alt tag are made smaller (50 was too
	  much IMO). # * Smiley images are put in the CSS class
	  "phorum-smiley", so users can # style the image if they want to. #
	  * Installation of a default list of smileys is taken out of #
	  include/db/mysql.php. This is now fully handled by the module
	  itself. # * Description for "thumbs up smiley" changed to "the
	  finger smiley". # * Smileys are now stored inside the module
	  directory itself. # * The configuration for the old smileys mod is
	  automatically converted.

   2005-10-10 13:59  mmakaay
	* New template feature: {HOOK hook_name arg1 arg2 .. argn} # Hooks
	  can now also be called in templates. This is solely for # being
	  able to let modules writers extend the forms that Phorum uses. #
	  If one hook argument is used, the hook code will translate to: #
	  phorum_hook(hook_name, arg1) # If multiple hook arguments are
	  used, it will translate to: # phorum_hook(hook_name, array(arg1,
	  arg2, .., argn)) # The hook may also be called without using
	  arguments.

   2005-10-08 05:01  brian

   2005-10-06 23:21  mmakaay

	  {FOCUS_TO_ID}.

   2005-10-06 05:00  brian
	* simplified the help pop up by ridding us of the iframe and the
	  extra js code in include.

   2005-10-05 15:20  brian

	  from the site.

   2005-10-04 05:02  brian
	* Added default forum settings. A forum can now inherit its settings

	* Implemented a buddy system for private messaging.

   2005-10-01 22:24  mmakaay
	* Added a new option "System Sanity Checks" to the admin panel. This
	  can be used to run a number of checks on the system to see if it
	  is configured correctly for using Phorum. # Implementation: # #
	  All checks are stored as single PHP files in the directory #
	  include/admin/sanity_checks/ # Each file you create there must at
	  least have the following: # # * A variable $check_description
	  which is set to the description # string that is showed in the
	  sanity checks result screen. # * A function named
	  phorum_check_<file basename> which does the # actual checking.
	  This function has to return two parameters. # The first one is one
	  of the constants PHORUM_SANITY_OK, # PHORUM_SANITY_WARN or
	  PHORUM_SANITY_CRIT. The second one # is a description of a problem
	  that was found or NULL in # case no problem was found. # # The
	  sanity checking frontend will then take care of the rest. # #
	  Already implemented checks are checks for: # - database connection
	  (Config available and can we connect?) # - cache directory (Can we
	  find and write there? And does caching work?) # - file uploading
	  (Checking PHP/MySQL max upload size against settings)

   2005-09-28 10:51  mmakaay
	* Fixed #123: when deleting a thread, also delete move notification

	  just one large template is processed on output (see #90 for
	  details)

   2005-09-16 13:39  mmakaay
	* Implemented a whole new backend for the PM system. This backend is
	  a preparation for a more sophisticated PM system which supports
	  things like user folders, buddy lists, multiple recipients and a
	  trash bin. # # Notes: # # Because the way messages are stored has
	  changed, the old PM calls # from mysql.php have been deprecated.
	  When calling these functions, # an error message will be shown.
	  This will only be done in case # non-Phorum scripts call the old
	  functions. Phorum uses the new API. # # In the database migration
	  script, dropping the old private messages # table is not yet
	  included, so in case of problems a rollback is # possible without
	  loosing the old private messages. This will be # incorporated as
	  soon as the new code has proven to be stable. # # New database
	  structure: # # {prefix}_pm_messages: holds the message data for a
	  PM # {prefix}_pm_folders: holds the custom folders for the users #
	  {prefix}_pm_xref: links users, messages and folders together # #
	  The inbox and outbox for the users are built-in special folders, #
	  so there will not be in {prefix}_pm_folders.

   2005-09-13 11:15  mmakaay
	* Added configuration option for setting max nr. of messages in the
	  PM storage of a user

   2005-09-12 23:01  mmakaay

	* Fixed some more line-ending properties

   2005-08-29 00:17  mmakaay
	* Disabled cumulative attachment size check in case no config value
	  is set

   2005-08-28 23:52  mmakaay
	* Added max cumulative size to attachment settings and some fixes: *
	  max cumulative size is used to be able to set a maximum total size
	  for all attachments together. So now you can allow for example 10
	  attachments of each 1 Mb max, but limit the total attachment size
	  to 2 Mb. So the user can upload for example either 10 photo's or 1
	  MP3 file, but not 10 MP3 files. * uploading one or more
	  attachments always replaced the complete list of attachments,
	  instead of adding attachments to it; * Added some more explanation
	  for the attachment admin parameters, to make clear what an empty
	  or zero value means to Phorum; * The list of allowed file types is
	  not shown anymore in the template case no list is set in the admin
	  interface (so you won't get "You are allowed to attach files of
	  the following type:" without any options behind it on screen);

   2005-08-28 18:49  mmakaay
	* Updates from #106
